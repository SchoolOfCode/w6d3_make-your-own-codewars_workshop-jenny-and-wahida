Your function will take in two words. 
Each letter in each word has a points value. 
Vowels will score 5 points each, consonants will score 2 points each.
Your function must return the word which has the highest score, along with the score, in the form: ["word", score]
If the score is a draw, return ["tie", score]

Inputs will always be strings

Example:

function("hello", "goodbye"):
hello would score 2+5+2+2+5 = 16
goodbye would score 2+5+5+2+2+2+5 = 23
function would return ["goodbye", 23]

function("HELLO", "APPLE"):
hello would score 2+5+2+2+5 = 16
apple would score 5+2+2+2+5 = 16
function would return ["tie", 16]

//check it works for variety of word inputs
//check it works for upper and lower case
