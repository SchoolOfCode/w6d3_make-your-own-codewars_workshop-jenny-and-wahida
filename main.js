/* 
ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!

Your function will take in two words. 
Each letter in each word has a points value. 
Vowels will score 5 points each, consonants will score 2 points each.
Your function must return the word which has the highest score, along with the score, in the form: ["word", score]
If the score is a draw, return ["tie", score]

Inputs will always be strings

Example:

function("hello", "goodbye"):
function would return ["goodbye", 23]

function("HOSPITAL", "HOTEL"):
function would return ["HOSPITAL", 25]

function("HELLO", "apple"):
function would return ["tie", 16]

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
export function scoreWord (word1, word2) {
let word1Score = 0;
let word2Score = 0;
let vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
let result = [];

for (let i=0; i<word1.length; i++){
    if(vowels.includes(word1[i])){word1Score += 5} else {word1Score += 2}
}

for (let i=0; i<word2.length; i++){
    if(vowels.includes(word2[i])){word2Score += 5} else {word2Score += 2}
}

if(word1Score > word2Score){
    result.push(word1)
    result.push(word1Score)
} else if (word2Score > word1Score) {
    result.push(word2)
    result.push(word2Score)
} else {
    result.push("tie")
    result.push(word1Score)
}
    return result;
    }
