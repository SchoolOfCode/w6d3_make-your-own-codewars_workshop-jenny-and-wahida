Word Battle!

Your function will take in two words. 

If either word includes any characters that aren't letters, your function should return: "This is an alien language"

To be a fair fight, the words must have the same number of letters. If the words do not have the same number of letters, your function should return: "It's not a fair fight!"

If the words do have the same number of letters, the fight is on! 

Each letter in each word has a points value. Vowels will score 5 points each, consonants will score 2 points each.
Your function must return the word which has the highest score, along with the score, in the form: ["word", score]
If the score is a draw, your function should return: ["tie", score]

Example:

function("hello", "alien"):
would return ["alien", 19]

function("HOTEL", "CRAMP"):
would return ["HOTEL", 16]

function("HELLO", "apple"):
would return ["tie", 16]

function("dopamine", "apple"):
would return "It's not a fair fight!"

function("letters", "%--"):
would return "This is an alien language"
